# Documentation Project #

The documentation of the Apache HTTP Server is a collaborative effort, made
possible by the participation of the entire HTTP Server community. We'd
love to have your help too.

-  [I want to report a problem](#report) 

-  [I'd like to make a suggestion](#suggestion) 

-  [I know how to use svn and want to checkout the latest manual](#svn) 

-  [I'd like to build the manual from local source](#build) 

-  [I'd like to join the docs team mailing list](#ml) 

-  [I want to help translate the documentation](#translate) 

-  [Actually, I was just looking for the docs](#docs) 

# Reporting a problem  {#report}

The best way to report a problem with the documentation is to make a comment
on the docs page in question, or to [open a
ticket](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Apache%20httpd-2&component=Documentation).
Select 'Documentation' as the component. Have a look at the [list of open
documentation bugs](http://s.apache.org/httpd-doc-bugs) to see if it's
already covered. We try to keep that list very short.

# Making a suggestion  {#suggestion}

If you have a suggestion of something that we could do better, or even want
to write a new or replacement document, there are a number of ways to go
about it.

The best way is probably to [join the mailing list](#ml) and strike up a
conversation. We always love to have new people on the project.

Or, you can [open a ticket](#report) , as discussed above. We are very
interested in your suggestions, and any way that you think we can improve
the documentation. We look forward to hearing from you.

The 2.2, 2.4 and trunk documentation also have a comment feature, where 
you can quickly add a comment about the documentation. To access this, 
click the "Comments" link on a page or simply scroll down to the bottom. 

# SVN information  {#svn}

Our documentation is kept in svn, along with the source code, and the
actual changes are all made there. If you intend to be a long-term
contributor to the documentation, the best thing to do is to get an svn
checkout and submit patches. We've got a [document that gives you all of
the necessary details](svn.html).

# Building the docs  {#build}

Once you have a checkout from SVN, you need to also check out the
docs-build directory and run the relevant build scripts to produce all of the
relevant transformations.  Please see [docs build](docsformat.html) for
more information.

# The docs mailing list  {#ml}

The discussion surrounding the documentation project happens on the
`docs@httpd.apache.org` mailing list. To subscribe to this mailing list,
send email to
[docs-subscribe@httpd.apache.org](mailto:docs-subscribe@httpd.apache.org)
and follow the instructions in the response you receive.

The archives of this mailing list may be found at
[lists.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?docs@httpd.apache.org) ,
if you want to have a preview of how we do things, and who the main
characters are.

# Translations  {#translate}

The documentation is available in several different languages. Some of
these translations are out of date, and some important languages are
missing. If you are fluent in a non-English language, and would like to
provide a translation of all or part of the documentation, there's [another
document](translations.html) about how to get started on that. Before you
get started, please [join the mailing list](#ml) , introduce yourself, and
let us know what you're working on. In that way, other translators can
coordinate with you in this effort.

# Where are the docs?  {#docs}

Documentation is available for several different versions of the server:

Online Documentation: [Version 2.0](../docs/2.0/) | [Version
2.2](../docs/2.2/) | [Version 2.4](../docs/2.4/) | [Version 2.5
(Development branch)](../docs/trunk/) |
[Wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/) 

Downloadable documentation in Microsoft Help (CHM) format is available from
our [distribution
mirrors](http://www.apache.org/dyn/mirrors/mirrors.cgi/httpd/docs/).
