# Apache HTTP Server Support #

There are several places to obtain support for Apache httpd. They are
presented here in the order in which you should probably consult them.

[The documentation](/docs/current) is the definitive
source for information about the Apache httpd. The answers to your questions
are probably there.

The [Apache HTTP Server Users List](/lists.html#http-users) , or the Usenet
groups listed on that same page, are great places to ask questions when you
are willing to wait a few hours, or possibly a few days, for an answer.
These lists are frequented by people intimately familiar with the Apache
httpd, who are willing to address your questions. You are strongly
encouraged to consult the [archives](http://httpd.markmail.org/) prior to
asking a question.

The `#httpd` channel on the
irc.libera.chat IRC network is a
good place for quick questions. If your questions require a more in-depth
answer, you will likely be encouraged to move the question to the mailing
list.

If you think that you have found a bug in the software, or if you have a
feature request, you can report these via the [bug report
page.](/bug_report.html) 

Commercial support for Apache httpd is available from a number of
third-party companies. We do not maintain a list of these companies,
however, and we encourage you to use your favorite search engine to find
one.
