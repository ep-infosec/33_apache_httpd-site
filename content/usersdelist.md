Title: Users-DE Mailing List
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

This mailing list is a place for users of the Apache HTTP Server to discuss
Apache and help each other to install and configure the software. Although
some developers may participate in the list, the primary interaction is
user-to-user.

Please read the following guidelines before posting to the list.

**There is no official support for the Apache HTTP Server:** 
>    This mailing list is for users to help other users. If you want
>    professional support, we suggest you contact a
>    [professional](http://www.apache.org/info/support.cgi).

**Ask smart questions:** 
>    Eric Raymond and Rick Moen have written a very useful guide to [Asking
>    Questions the Smart
>    Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). **Do not**
>    send Apache questions to Eric or Rick!

**Send in plain text:** 
>    Many email programs including Microsoft Outlook default to sending
>    HTML or other *styled* email. Please configure your email client to
>    send plain text so that everyone will be able to read your message.

**Send German mails:** 
>    The users-de list is a German-language mailing list. English mails
>    should be directed to our [English-language mailing
>    list](userslist.html).

**Don't ask FAQs:** 
>    Be sure to read the [FAQ](http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/FAQ) and search
>    the [archives](#archives) before you post.

**Find the best group:** 
>    Although we welcome discussion of anything related to the Apache HTTP
>    Server, you will have the most luck in getting problems solved if you
>    ask your questions in the group most targeted to your problem. For
>    example, if you have a problem with a module that is not distributed
>    as part of the standard Apache HTTP Server, you will probably find a
>    more knowledgable group by sending to a mailing list devoted to that
>    module. In general, mails to these groups should be sent in English.
>    Some examples:

-  [PHP](http://www.php.net/support.php) 

-  [mod_perl](http://perl.apache.org/#maillists) 

-  [Jakarta/mod_jk/mod_webapp](http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html) 

-  [mod_ssl](http://www.modssl.org/support/)
