# Users Mailing List  {#Welcome}

This mailing list is a place for users of the Apache HTTP Server to discuss
Apache and help each other to install and configure the software. Although
some developers may participate in the list, the primary interaction is
user-to-user.

# List Policies  {#policies}

From the welcome message each subscriber receives:

Posting is only permitted by subscribed addresses as an anti-spam
measure. The list is moderated by volunteers from the Apache Software
Foundation; moderation will mostly be notable by its absence. However,
blatant abuse of the forum's purpose or the sensibilities of the
subscribers will not be tolerated. Any action taken by the moderators is
final, solely at their discretion, and not subject to formal appeal.

# Subscribe  {#subscribe}

To subscribe, send an empty message to
**users-subscribe@httpd.apache.org** . You will receive a
confirmation message with instructions on how to validate your
subscription. After you have subscribed, you can post to the list by

You cannot post to the list without subscribing.

If you prefer to receive a digest version of the list that sends groups of
messages in a single email, you can subscribe by sending an empty message
to **users-digest-subscribe@httpd.apache.org** .

# Un-Subscribe  {#unsubscribe}

To unsubscribe, send a messages to **users-unsubscribe@httpd.apache.org**

the unsubscribe message from the same email address that you used to

To complete the unsubscription process you must reply to a confirmation
email. If you do not receive this confirmation email, please check your

you can contact the list administrator at
`users-owner@httpd.apache.org` to get help.

# Guidelines  {#guidelines}

Please read the following guidelines before posting to the list.

**There is no official support for the Apache HTTP Server:**
    

>  This mailing list is for users to help other users. If you want
>      professional support, there are a number of companies that provide
>      such services. We do not, however, maintain a list of them, and
>      recommend that you use your favorite search engine.

**Ask smart questions:** 
    

>  Eric Raymond and Rick Moen have written a very useful guide to
>  [Asking Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). **Do not**
>  send Apache questions to Eric or Rick!

**Send in plain text:**    
> Many email programs including Microsoft Outlook default to sending
> HTML or other styled email. Please configure your email client to
> send plain text so that everyone will be able to read your message.

**Send English mails:** 
>  This list is an English-language mailing list. German-speaking users
>  may subscribe to our [German-language mailing list](usersdelist.html).

**Don't ask FAQs:** 
>  Be sure to read the [FAQ](http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/FAQ) and search
>  the [archives](#archives) before you post.

**Find the best group:** 

> Although we welcome discussion of anything related to the Apache HTTP
>      Server, you will have the most luck in getting problems solved if you
>      ask your questions in the group most targeted to your problem. For
>      example, if you have a problem with a module that is not distributed
>      as part of the standard Apache HTTP Server, you will probably find a
>      more knowledgable group by sending to a mailing list devoted to that
>      module. Some examples:
> 
> -  [PHP](http://www.php.net/support.php) 
> -  [mod_perl](http://perl.apache.org/maillist/modperl.html) 
> -  [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html)
